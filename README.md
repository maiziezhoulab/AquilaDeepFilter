# AquilaDeepFilter

## Introduction 


<!-- 1. Run the upstream SV caller (such as Aquila, Delly) to generate the VCF file which includes structrual variants.

2. Preprocess VCF file to add header if needed (eg. make 1 -> chr1), and split it into INS and DEL for Truvari evaluation.

3. Get the Truvari evaluated VCF results as the training bed files and raw VCF results as the validation files.  

4. Converting to images and augmentation.

5. Training with CNNs.

6. Get the output BED file back to VCF files.

7. Ensemble strategy.

8. Evaluate with Truvari again to see the performance of our model. -->

Computational methods based on whole genome linked-reads and short reads have been successful in genome assembly and detection of structural variants (SVs). Numerous variant callers that rely on linked-reads and short reads can detect genetic variations, including SVs.  A shortcoming of existing tools is a propensity for overestimating SVs, especially for deletions. Optimizing the advantages of linked-read and short-read sequencing technologies would thus benefit from an additional step to effectively identify and eliminate false positive large deletions. Here, we introduce a novel tool, AquilaDeepFilter, aiming to automatically filter genome-wide false positive large deletions. Our approach relies on transforming sequencing data into an image and then relying on several convolutional neural networks to improve classification of candidate deletions as such. Input data take into account multiple alignment signals including read depth, split reads and discordant read pairs. AquilaDeepFilter is thus an effective SV refinement framework that can improve SV calling for both linked-reads and short-read data.

The general workflow of AquilaDeepFilter works as follows:

## Pipeline

**Part 1. Image construction**

a. create bed files for SV image construction (training data/evaluation data)

use **vcf2bed_training.py** and **vcf2bed_val.py** to generate .bed files before generating images

will have **3** .bed files as the output of **vcf2bed_training.py**

will have **1** .bed file as the output of **vcf2bed_val.py**

b. generate image from the .bed files (generated in last step) and .bam files (used for SV calling)

use **bed2image.py** to generate training/testing images. For training images, positive samples are generated from 2 .bed files corresponding to TP.vcf and FN.vcf while negative samples are generated from 1 .bed file corresponding to FP.vcf

c. augmentate the images generated in last step

use **augmentate.py** to augmentate the images

**Part 2. Model training**

a. split the training data with customized ratio

use **train_test_split.py** to split the data. Specifically, the input folder should have 2 subfolders for positive and negative samples respectively.

b. train the model with the split images in train and val folders

use **train** in **main.py** to train the model with saved checkpoints and loss

**Part 3. Truvari evaluation**

a. predict the evaluation data with the saved weights

(a-optional. ensemble prediction results from several models)

b. generate several filtered bed/vcf files with different thresholds

c. prepare (sort, zip and index) the vcf files for Truvari input format

d. perform evaluation and report metrics
